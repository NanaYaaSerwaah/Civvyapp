### Backlog Notes & Constraints

1. **Limit code changes to a minimum**  
   * Re-use existing feed, reward, and notification modules where possible.  
2. **Rate-limit all new API endpoints**  
   * Default: `60 req / min / IP`, adjustable via env variables.  
3. **Enable Captcha** on any new forms (e.g., ride-share buddy requests, donation flag submissions).  
4. Each feature must include **WCAG 2.2 AA** accessibility acceptance criteria.  
5. Security review required for any new data source (e.g., donation APIs).
